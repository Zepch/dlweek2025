1. Architecture Overview
I propose a hybrid architecture with three main components:
Market Data → Feature Engineering → ML Pipeline → Trading Decisions → Performance Evaluation

Core Components:

Macroeconomic indicators
Hierarchical Temporal Learning

Short-term patterns: LSTM/GRU networks
Long-term dependencies: Transformer architecture
Regime detection: Hidden Markov Models
Adaptive Decision System

Reinforcement Learning agent for position sizing and timing
Risk-adjusted reward function with portfolio constraints
